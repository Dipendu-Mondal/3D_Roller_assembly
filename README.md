Roller Belt Support – 3D Printing Setup

This project contains the 3D models and slicing setup for the roller belt support assembly, prepared for fabrication using an Ultimaker S5 printer in Ultimaker Cura.

📂 Project Overview

The roller belt support consists of multiple components designed for mechanical stability and ease of assembly. The parts include:

Base plate

Brackets (for roller mounting)

Bushings

Shafts

Additional connecting parts

All components were exported as STL files and arranged in a single build plate for efficient printing.

⚙️ Printing Configuration

Printer: Ultimaker S5

Slicer: Ultimaker Cura

Layer Height: 0.1 mm (Fine – Engineering profile)

Infill: Default (20% recommended for strength)

Supports: Enabled (for overhangs on brackets and shafts)

Adhesion: Skirt/Brim as needed

🕒 Estimated Print Details

Total Time: ~3 days 19 hours 48 minutes

Material Usage: 304 g (approx. 38.41 m filament)

Build Volume Used: 283.5 × 194.6 × 80.0 mm

🛠 Assembly Notes

After printing, remove supports carefully to avoid damaging thin shafts.

Bushings are designed for a snug fit; minor sanding may be required.

Assemble the brackets and shafts onto the base plate before inserting bushings.

Ensure proper alignment of rollers to reduce friction during belt movement.

🚀 Applications

Conveyor belt systems

Lab-scale automation setups

Material handling prototypes

🔧 Future Improvements

Optimize print orientation to reduce support material.

Experiment with higher infill for load-bearing parts.

Test alternative materials (e.g., PETG, Nylon, Carbon Fiber).
